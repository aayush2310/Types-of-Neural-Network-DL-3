Types of Neural Network:-
1)Multi Layer Perceptron:-Multiple layers of perceptron(nodes) called input layer,hidden layer and output layer.Used specially in supervised ML problems like regression 
                          and classification.Great when we want to capture non-linear relationship.
2)Convonutional Neural Network:-This is a special type of neural network in which atleast one layer is convonutional layer.Used in image processing like self friving cars,
                                detect lung cancer cells.
3)Recurrent Neural Network:-Till now what we discussed,the input info. goes from the input layer to the o/p layer in a linear fashion,but in RNN the o/p of one layer comes
                            as feedback to another layer and then goes forward.A good variation of it is LSTM(long short term memory)Used most frequently in natural lang.
                            based processing applications.(eg:-siri)
4)Auto encoders:-We have an i/p data which we want to compress without losing the quality.Here the i/p layers and o/p layers have equal number of nodes but the hidden layers
                 have less number of nodes.
5)Generative Adverserial Networks:-We can perform imagintion using artificial neural network.An architecture was created where two neural networks compete with each other,
                                   one is called generator and the other is called discriminator.We can generate an imaginative image.can generate stories,music,etc.
